# openHAB OSGi-ify

This repository contains OSGI-ified versions of dependencies of the openHAB project.

This is still WIP and it is recommended not to rely on any of the structure currently in place.

Until further notice the repository maybe rewritten and break your fork.
Take care.

Individual bundles may have different licenses.
